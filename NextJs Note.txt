What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. 
You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.
======================================
Main Features

Routing	A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.
Rendering	Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes.
Data Fetching	Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended fetch API for request memoization, data caching and revalidation.
Styling	Support for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS
Optimizations	Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals and User Experience.
TypeScript	Improved support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker.
======================================
Motivation: 
Part of React's success is that it is relatively unopinionated about the other aspects of building applications. This has resulted in a flourishing ecosystem of third-party tools and solutions, including Next.js.
